    -git branch: lists all local branches
    -git branch -a : lists all branches remote and local branches(remote branches are seen after adding a remote git repository).
    to create a git branch: git branch *name* master( i.e to clone "master") 
    git checkout: is used to switch from different branches e.g from masterr to development
    git checkout -b "name": takes the current state of the branch you are on, clone the branch with the name you have specified and also switch to the new branch
